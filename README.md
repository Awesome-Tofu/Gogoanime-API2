# Gogoanime-API
This is a personal project that I am working on 🧰
it is a simple api for scrapping 🔪 gogoanime.so 

**How to use the API ?**
<br />
🔢 step 1
```
npm install
```
this should install all the dependencies required for running this project

<br />
🔢 step 2
```
node app.js
```
Now you might get a output similar to this

```
Listening to port 3000
```
🥳 Yay, our API server is running 🏃‍♂️💨
